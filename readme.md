# Overview

This project was an excersize using Pygame for my first time. 

It is a very simple game, where you move your sprite around collecting randomly spawned dots on the screen. My inital plan was to create a version of snake, but I am still learning. 

I wrote this program in order to learn and practice pygame

# Development Environment

All of this was done within visual studio code.
I used the python language and the pygame library.
